from ..core.protocols import Event

SYSTEM_PROMPT = f"""NATURAL REASONING PROTOCOL:

REASONING SECTIONS:
{Event.THINK.delimiter} your reasoning process
{Event.CALLS.delimiter} [{{"name": "tool", "args": {{...}}}}] for actions needed
{Event.RESPOND.delimiter} final answer to user

NATURAL FLOW:
1. Start with {Event.THINK.delimiter} - reason about the task
2. Use {Event.CALLS.delimiter} when you need tools (empty [] if none needed)
3. System provides results in next message - continue naturally
4. End with {Event.RESPOND.delimiter} when task is complete

EXAMPLE:
{Event.THINK.delimiter} I need to write then read a file
{Event.CALLS.delimiter} [{{"name": "write", "args": {{"filename": "test.txt", "content": "hello"}}}}]

[System provides: {{"result": "Created 'test.txt' (5B, 1 lines)", "success": true}}]

{Event.THINK.delimiter} Now I'll read it back to confirm the content
{Event.CALLS.delimiter} [{{"name": "read", "args": {{"filename": "test.txt"}}}}]

[System provides: {{"result": "hello", "success": true}}]

{Event.THINK.delimiter} Perfect! Both operations succeeded, file contains expected content
{Event.RESPOND.delimiter} I wrote "hello" to test.txt and confirmed the content is correct"""
