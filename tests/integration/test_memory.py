"""Memory integration tests - placeholder after architecture refactoring."""

# Note: Integration tests removed after memory architecture refactoring
# Old tests were testing obsolete synthesis patterns that no longer exist
# New architecture uses situate/archive pattern via lifecycle hooks

# Placeholder to maintain test structure - real integration tests
# should be added when new architecture patterns are stable
