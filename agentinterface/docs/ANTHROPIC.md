# AgentInterface vs Anthropic Artifacts

## What Anthropic Built

Claude manually decides when to render artifacts:

```
User: "Write a React component"
Claude: [Automatically renders in code artifact container]
```

**Limitation:** Only works with Claude. Manual component selection.

## What AgentInterface Enables

Any agent systematically selects optimal UI:

```python
# Any agent becomes artifact-capable
agent = ai(openai_agent, llm)
result = await agent("Write a React component")
# Returns: (text, [{"type": "code", "data": {"language": "javascript", "content": "..."}}])
```

**Advancement:** Universal agent compatibility. Systematic component selection.

## Technical Comparison

| Feature | Anthropic Artifacts | AgentInterface |
|---------|-------------------|----------------|
| Agent Support | Claude only | Universal |
| Component Types | Fixed (code, docs) | Extensible ecosystem |
| Selection Logic | Manual heuristics | LLM-driven optimization |
| Composition | Single artifacts | Infinite nesting |
| Bidirectional | Limited | Full callback support |

## Architecture Evolution

**Anthropic's Innovation:** Agents can trigger structured UI beyond text

**AgentInterface Extension:** 
- Any agent, not just Claude
- Any component type, not just artifacts  
- Systematic selection, not manual heuristics
- Ecosystem extensibility, not fixed types

## Strategic Positioning

AgentInterface builds on Anthropic's core insight while generalizing it into infrastructure. This enables the artifact experience for any agent framework while expanding beyond code/document containers.

**Anthropic proved the concept. AgentInterface scales the implementation.**
