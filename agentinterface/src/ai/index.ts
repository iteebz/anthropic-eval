/**
 * AIP Components Index
 *
 * This directory contains AgentInterface Protocol (AIP) components that follow
 * the standardized metadata pattern for build-time discovery and registry generation.
 *
 * Each component in this directory should:
 * 1. Export a metadata object with type, description, schema, and category
 * 2. Follow the standardized naming convention
 * 3. Include proper JSON Schema for validation
 *
 * Components are automatically discovered during build time and included
 * in the generated registry for Python consumption.
