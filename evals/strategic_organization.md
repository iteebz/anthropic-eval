# Strategic Evaluation Organization - AGI Lab Demo Flow

## TIER 1: FOUNDATION COMPETENCE (Quick Pass/Fail)
*"Does Cogency work at all? Are we wasting time here?"*

**Goal**: Establish basic credibility in 2-3 minutes
**Sample Size**: Minimal but comprehensive (50 total tests)
**Execution Time**: <3 minutes  

```python
foundation_competence = {
    "basic_agent_function": 10,      # Can respond, follow instructions
    "basic_tool_usage": 15,          # Can execute files/shell commands  
    "basic_memory": 10,              # Can store/recall simple data
    "basic_security": 15,            # Resists obvious prompt injection
    # TOTAL: 50 tests, 2-3 minute execution
}
```

## TIER 2: COMPETITIVE DIFFERENTIATION (Core Value Props) 
*"What makes Cogency unique? Why should I care?"*

**Goal**: Demonstrate killer features that competitors can't match
**Sample Size**: Substantial but focused (75 total tests)
**Execution Time**: 10-15 minutes

```python
competitive_differentiation = {
    "cross_session_memory_workflows": 25,    # NO OTHER AGENT DOES THIS WELL
    "multi_step_tool_orchestration": 25,     # PRODUCTION-READY COORDINATION  
    "graceful_error_recovery": 15,           # ROBUST FAILURE HANDLING
    "workflow_state_management": 10,         # COMPLEX TASK CONTINUATION
    # TOTAL: 75 tests showcasing unique capabilities
}
```

## TIER 3: PRODUCTION READINESS (Risk Mitigation)
*"Can I deploy this without it breaking my systems?"*

**Goal**: Prove enterprise-grade robustness and safety
**Sample Size**: Comprehensive edge cases (60 total tests)  
**Execution Time**: 8-12 minutes

```python
production_readiness = {
    "security_hardening": 20,               # Advanced prompt injection resistance
    "error_boundary_management": 15,        # Graceful degradation under stress
    "resource_constraint_handling": 10,     # Memory/time limit adaptation
    "concurrent_operation_safety": 15,      # Multi-user/multi-task stability  
    # TOTAL: 60 tests proving deployment safety
}
```

## TIER 4: INDUSTRY BENCHMARKING (Competitive Analysis)
*"How does this compare to existing solutions?"*

**Goal**: Establish credibility against public benchmarks
**Sample Size**: Statistically meaningful (50 total tests)
**Execution Time**: 15-20 minutes (expensive LLM calls)

```python
industry_benchmarking = {
    "swe_bench_lite": 30,                   # Software engineering tasks
    "gaia_authentic": 20,                   # Multi-step reasoning with tools
    # TOTAL: 50 tests against public benchmarks
}
```

## STRATEGIC EXECUTION FLOW

### DEMO SEQUENCE (45-50 minutes total)
1. **Foundation** (3 min) → Immediate credibility check
2. **Differentiation** (15 min) → Core value demonstration  
3. **Production** (12 min) → Risk mitigation proof
4. **Benchmarking** (20 min) → Competitive positioning

### EARLY EXIT STRATEGY
- If Foundation fails → "Not ready for evaluation"
- If Differentiation weak → "Interesting but not compelling"
- If Production issues → "Promising but risky" 
- If Benchmarks poor → "Good internally but uncompetitive"

### PROGRESSIVE DISCLOSURE
Each tier builds on previous:
- Foundation → "Worth evaluating"  
- Differentiation → "Uniquely valuable"
- Production → "Safe to deploy"
- Benchmarking → "Competitive option"

## DEMO FLOW ORCHESTRATION

**Executive Summary Generator:**
Each tier produces executive-friendly metrics:
- Foundation: "Basic functionality: 48/50 tests passed (96%)"
- Differentiation: "Unique capabilities: Memory workflows 92%, Orchestration 88%" 
- Production: "Enterprise readiness: Error recovery 93%, Security hardening 95%"
- Benchmarking: "Industry performance: SWE-bench 67%, GAIA 74%"

**Risk Flags:**
- Red: Foundation failures (stop evaluation)
- Yellow: Production concerns (deployment risk)
- Green: Competitive advantage demonstrated

**Investment Recommendation:**
Based on tier performance, auto-generate:
- "STRONG HIRE" (all tiers green)
- "PROMISING" (differentiation strong, production needs work)  
- "NOT READY" (foundation or differentiation weak)
