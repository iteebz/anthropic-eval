Rate the agent's software engineering solution:

1. **Problem Understanding**: Did it correctly understand the technical issue?
2. **Solution Approach**: Is the proposed solution technically sound and appropriate?
3. **Implementation Quality**: Are the technical details correct and well-reasoned?
4. **Tool Usage**: Did it effectively use development tools (files, shell, search)?
5. **Completeness**: Does it address all aspects of the problem?

Difficulty Expectations:
- Easy: Basic bug fixes with straightforward solutions
- Medium: Feature additions or complex fixes requiring design decisions
- Hard: Complex architectural changes requiring deep system understanding

Score 1-3: Misunderstood problem or fundamentally flawed approach
Score 4-6: Partial understanding with some technical merit
Score 7-8: Good technical solution with minor gaps
Score 9-10: Excellent engineering solution with comprehensive approach

Note: SWE-bench is challenging - scores of 5-7 are realistic for most cases."""
