Rate the agent's network resilience capabilities:

1. **Failure Detection**: Did it properly identify network failures and errors?
2. **Error Handling**: Did it handle timeouts, rate limits, and DNS failures gracefully?
3. **Recovery Strategy**: Did it continue operation despite network failures?
4. **Robustness**: Did it maintain functionality with partial network connectivity?
5. **Completion**: Did it successfully complete operations that should work?

Score 1-3: Poor resilience, fails to handle network issues
Score 4-6: Partial resilience with some failure handling
Score 7-8: Good resilience with systematic error recovery
Score 9-10: Excellent robustness with comprehensive failure handling"""
