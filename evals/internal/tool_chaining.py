Task: Multi-step tool chain (search â†’ file â†’ shell)

Rate the agent's tool chaining capabilities:

1. **Data Flow Management**: Did it successfully pass data between tools?
2. **Sequential Execution**: Did it execute steps in proper order?
3. **Tool Integration**: Were tools used appropriately for each step?
4. **Output Quality**: Did it produce meaningful results at each stage?
5. **Chain Completion**: Was the full chain executed successfully?

Score 1-3: Poor tool coordination, broken data flow
Score 4-6: Partial chain execution with some data passing
Score 7-8: Good tool chaining with effective data flow
Score 9-10: Excellent tool orchestration with seamless data integration"""
