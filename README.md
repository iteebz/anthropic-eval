# Coordination Infrastructure Research

**Multi-agent AI systems collapse within minutes. This research explores why‚Äîand builds the infrastructure to fix it.**

Two working systems + systematic research into extending agent autonomy from 10-minute to month-level horizons. Demonstrates human-AI hybrid methodology producing coordinated technical systems through 60-day development sprint.

**Core Innovation:** WebSocket streaming consciousness eliminating O(n¬≤) context replay + constitutional frameworks for sustained AI coordination.

## Critical Documents

### üéØ [docs/frontiers.md](docs/frontiers.md) - Research Framework  
Coordination infrastructure requirements and scaling dimensions:
- Current limitation: Human intervention required every ~10 minutes  
- Intelligence ‚Üí Autonomy ‚Üí Coordination scaling trajectory
- Infrastructure patterns for extended agent autonomy

### üèóÔ∏è [docs/trajectory.md](docs/trajectory.md) - Coordination Architecture
Research trajectory toward autonomous agent coordination:
- Inbox-driven coordination with persistent memory
- Democratic oversight with human escalation protocols
- Infrastructure requirements for month-level agent autonomy

### ‚öîÔ∏è [docs/zealot.md](docs/zealot.md) - Constitutional AI Methodology
AI systems that resist complexity through constitutional identity:
- Framework for sustained AI disagreement and architectural purity
- Empirical evidence: August 27 system rebuilds in single day
- **Critical enabler**: This methodology powered the research velocity

### üìã [docs/timeline.md](docs/timeline.md) - Development Evidence

- Two working systems built through iterative human-AI collaboration  
- Constitutional methodology emergence and architectural purge patterns
- Streaming consciousness development sprint timing

## Implementation Evidence

### üí° [cogency/](cogency/) - Streaming Consciousness
WebSocket bidirectional streaming with tool injection:
- **Architecture:** Eliminates O(n¬≤) context replay scaling through persistent sessions
- **Implementation:** Delimiter protocol for state machine transitions  
- **Providers:** Unified abstraction across OpenAI/Gemini/Anthropic
- **Development:** July 11 ‚Üí September 1 iterative progression

### üé® [agentinterface/](agentinterface/) - Agent-UI Protocols  
Component selection protocols for agent-to-interface communication:
- **Innovation:** Agents select UI components through registry autodiscovery
- **Architecture:** Universal wrapper pattern with zero coupling
- **Discovery:** Metadata-driven component scanning and JSON generation
- **Development:** July 10 ‚Üí August 27 architectural purge ‚Üí rebuild


## Research Documentation

### üìö [writing/](writing/) - Research Methodology Documentation
8 pieces documenting coordination patterns and human-AI collaboration methods:
- **1_haven.md** - Early AI dependency research and memory architecture
- **2_copy-paste.md** - Manual multi-agent coordination failure analysis
- **3_zealot.md** - Constitutional AI framework for sustained disagreement
- **4_streaming.md** - WebSocket streaming consciousness architecture
- **5_agent-interface.md** - Agent-UI protocol innovation
- **6_coordination.md** - Multi-agent system collapse patterns and solutions
- **7_activation-transfer.md** - Safety research on direct activation transfer  
- **8_hybrid-researcher.md** - Human-AI collaborative research methodology

## Testing

**Requirements:** Python 3.11+, OpenAI/Gemini API key  

**Note:** Anthropic doesn't support WebSocket streaming (only HTTP + Server-Sent Events). Cogency's dual-mode architecture provides automatic fallback compatibility while being ready for when Anthropic adds WebSocket support.

```bash
cd cogency && poetry install && poetry run pytest tests/
cd agentinterface && npm test
```


## The Question

**How do you scale from individual AI capability to organizational AI intelligence?**

**Current Reality:** Multi-agent systems require human intervention every ~10 minutes  
**Research Target:** Month-level autonomous coordination without collapse  
**Infrastructure Gap:** The coordination layer between AI capability and AI organizations

**Methodology:** Systematic human-AI collaboration producing working coordination systems while documenting the collaborative process itself

**Meta-Insight:** This respository demonstrates the exact coordination patterns it claims to solve
