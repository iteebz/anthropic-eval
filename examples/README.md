# Cogency Examples

**Agents that just work.** 5-line demos to complete applications.

## Quick Start

```bash
python hello.py
```

## Showcases

**Autonomous Coder** - Apps from single commands:
```bash
python coder.py    # → Task API with auth, tests, Docker
```

**Intelligence Analyst** - Multi-source research:
```bash  
python research.py # → Market analysis with recommendations
```

**DevOps Automation** - Self-configuring infrastructure:
```bash
python devops.py   # → CI/CD pipeline with K8s manifests
```

**ML Pipeline** - Data to deployed model:
```bash
python ml.py       # → Churn prediction with MLOps
```

**Persistent Memory** - Cross-conversation context:
```bash
python memory.py   # → Remembers role, stack, constraints
```

**Tool Composition** - Mix and match capabilities:
```bash
python tool_composition.py  # → DevOps, research, web, custom tools
```

## What Makes These Special

- **Adaptive Intelligence**: Fast for simple, deep reasoning for complex
- **Zero Configuration**: No prompts, no setup - just natural language
- **Production Ready**: Working code with tests, error handling, best practices
- **Memory Enabled**: Context across sessions

**Intelligence that scales automatically** from trivial to transformative tasks.
