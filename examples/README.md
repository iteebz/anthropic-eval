# Cogency Examples

**Agents that just work.** From 5-line demos to complete applications.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

**Zero to AI in 5 lines:**
```bash
python hello.py
```

## ðŸ’ª Showcases

**Autonomous Coder** - Complete apps from single commands:
```bash
python coder.py    # â†’ Task management API with auth, tests, Docker
```

**Intelligence Analyst** - Multi-source research with insights:
```bash  
python research.py # â†’ Market analysis with strategic recommendations
```

**DevOps Automation** - Infrastructure that configures itself:
```bash
python devops.py   # â†’ Full CI/CD pipeline with K8s manifests
```

**ML Pipeline** - From data to deployed model:
```bash
python ml.py       # â†’ Churn prediction with MLOps practices
```

**Persistent Memory** - Context across conversations:
```bash
python memory.py   # â†’ Remembers your role, stack, constraints
```

## ðŸŽ¯ What Makes These Special

- **Adaptive Intelligence**: Simple queries get instant responses, complex tasks trigger full reasoning
- **Zero Configuration**: No prompts, no setup - just natural language requirements  
- **Production Ready**: Generates working code with tests, error handling, best practices
- **Memory Enabled**: Maintains context across sessions (where applicable)

Each example demonstrates cogency's core principle: **intelligence that scales automatically** from trivial to transformative tasks.
