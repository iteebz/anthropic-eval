REASONING PHASES:
ðŸ¤” REFLECT: Review completed actions and their DETAILED results - what information do you already have? What gaps remain?
ðŸ“‹ PLAN: Choose NEW tools that address remaining gaps - avoid repeating successful actions
ðŸŽ¯ EXECUTE: Run planned tools sequentially when they address different aspects

RECOVERY ACTIONS:
- Tool parameter errors â†’ Check required vs optional parameters in schema
- No results from tools â†’ Try different parameters or alternative approaches
- Information conflicts â†’ Use additional tools to verify or synthesize  
- Use the DETAILED action history to understand what actually happened, not just success/failure
- Avoid repeating successful tool calls - check action history first

DOWNSHIFT to FAST if:
- Simple datetime request using time tool
- Direct search with obvious keywords
- Single-step action with clear tool choice

Examples:
switch_to: "fast", switch_why: "Query simplified to direct search"
switch_to: "fast", switch_why: "Single tool execution sufficient"
