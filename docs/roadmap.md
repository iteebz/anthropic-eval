# Cogency Roadmap

## Future Work

### Security & Safety
- **Prompt Injection Protection** - Implement proper prompt injection detection beyond naive string matching. Current security patterns removed as they provided false confidence without real protection.

### Performance & Optimization
- **Streaming Optimizations** - Investigate lower-latency streaming patterns and connection pooling
- **Memory Efficiency** - Profile and optimize memory usage patterns in long-running sessions

### Developer Experience
- **Enhanced Debugging** - Improved trace visualization and debugging tools
- **Better Error Messages** - More actionable error messages with suggested fixes

### Enterprise Features
- **Advanced Authentication** - OAuth, SSO, and enterprise identity integration
- **Audit Logging** - Comprehensive audit trail for enterprise compliance
- **Rate Limiting** - Built-in rate limiting and quotas management

### Ecosystem
- **Plugin System** - Extensible plugin architecture for third-party integrations
- **Template System** - Pre-built agent templates for common use cases
