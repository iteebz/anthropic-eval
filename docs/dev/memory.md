# Situated Memory: LLM-Native Memory Architecture

> **Core Principle**: LLMs ARE memory systems. Stop fighting their natural capabilities with external search.

## Abstract

Situated Memory shifts from RAG to Direct Context Injection (DCI) - embedding memory directly in LLM reasoning context rather than external retrieval. Leverages LLM attention for relevance filtering and enables memory formation through reasoning, not similarity matching.

**Core insight**: Memory as curated understanding, not raw storage.

## Paradigm Comparison

### Traditional RAG Architecture
```
Query â†’ Vector Search â†’ Retrieved Chunks â†’ LLM Reasoning â†’ Response
```
- External similarity matching via embeddings
- Fragmented, decontextualized facts
- Separate retrieval and reasoning phases
- Limited synthesis capabilities

### Situated Memory Architecture  
```
Query + Memory Context â†’ LLM Reasoning â†’ Response + Memory Update
```
- Direct context injection with LLM attention filtering
- Holistic user impressions through synthesis
- Unified memory and reasoning cycles
- Natural contradiction resolution

## Implementation Architecture

### Core Memory Class

```python
class Memory:
    """LLM-native memory system - user impression through reasoning."""
    
    def __init__(self, llm):
        self.llm = llm
        self.recent = ""          # Raw recent interactions
        self.impression = ""      # Synthesized user impression  
        self.synthesis_threshold = 16000
    
    async def remember(self, content: str, human: bool = False) -> None:
        """Remember information with human weighting."""
        weight = "[HUMAN]" if human else "[AGENT]"
        self.recent += f"\n{weight} {content}"
        
        if len(self.recent) > self.synthesis_threshold:
            await self._synthesize()
    
    async def recall(self) -> str:
        """Recall impression context for reasoning."""
        context = ""
        if self.impression:
            context += f"USER IMPRESSION:\n{self.impression}\n\n"
        if self.recent:
            context += f"RECENT INTERACTIONS:\n{self.recent}\n\n"
        return context
```

### Two-Layer Memory Model

1. **Recent Layer**: Raw interactions with human/agent weighting
2. **Impression Layer**: LLM-synthesized understanding of user

This mirrors human memory formation - detailed short-term memory that synthesizes into long-term impressions.

### Human Priority Weighting

```python
# Human statements prioritized in synthesis
"[HUMAN] I prefer TypeScript over JavaScript"    # Weight: 1.0
"[AGENT] User seems to prefer functional style"  # Weight: 0.3
```

Critical for handling contradictions and maintaining user agency in memory formation.

## Integration Points

### Agent Integration
```python
class Agent:
    def __init__(self, name: str, memory: bool = False):
        self.memory = Memory(self.llm) if memory else None
    
    async def run(self, query: str) -> str:
        # Learn from user input
        if self.memory:
            await self.memory.remember(query, human=True)
        
        # Inject memory context into reasoning
        memory_context = await self.memory.recall() if self.memory else ""
        
        # ... reasoning with situated memory ...
        
        # Learn from agent response  
        if self.memory and response:
            await self.memory.remember(f"Agent: {response}", human=False)
```

### Phase Integration

**Preprocessing**: Extract user facts from queries
```python
if memory and extracted_facts:
    await memory.remember(extracted_facts, human=True)
```

**Reasoning**: Inject memory context into prompts
```python
memory_context = await memory.recall() if memory else ""
reasoning_prompt = f"{memory_context}{base_prompt}"
```

**Response**: Learn from agent outputs
```python  
if memory and response:
    await memory.remember(f"Agent: {response}", human=False)
```

## Memory vs Workspace: Persistent vs Ephemeral Context

**Memory**: Persistent user context across conversations (identity, preferences, long-term facts)
**Workspace**: Ephemeral reasoning state within tasks (objective, approach, discoveries, understanding)

## Memory Synthesis

### Automatic Compression
When recent interactions exceed 16K tokens, LLM performs synthesis:

```python
async def _synthesize(self) -> None:
    prompt = f"""Form a refined impression of this user based on their interactions:

Current Impression: {self.impression}
Recent Interactions: {self.recent}

Create a cohesive user impression that:
- Captures essential preferences, goals, and context
- Prioritizes human statements over agent observations
- Builds understanding over time rather than just facts
- Eliminates contradictions and redundancy
- Maintains personal context and behavioral patterns

Refined Impression:"""

    self.impression = await self.llm.complete(prompt)
    self.recent = ""
```

### Synthesis Principles
- **Human primacy**: User statements override agent inferences
- **Contradiction resolution**: LLM reasoning eliminates conflicts
- **Pattern recognition**: Behavioral understanding over fact storage
- **Compression**: Essential information preserved, noise eliminated

## API Design Philosophy

### Zero Ceremony Interface
```python
# Single line activation
agent = Agent("assistant", memory=True)

# Natural learning
await agent.run("I prefer TypeScript")
await agent.run("What language should I use?")  # Recalls preference
```

### Canonical API
- `memory.remember(content, human=bool)` - Add information with weighting
- `memory.recall()` - Get memory context for reasoning
- No external dependencies, configuration, or ceremony

## Technical Advantages

### Performance Benefits
- **No retrieval latency**: Memory embedded in reasoning context
- **Single LLM call**: Unified memory and reasoning
- **Natural relevance**: LLM attention handles filtering dynamically

### Architectural Simplicity  
- **Zero dependencies**: No vector databases or embeddings
- **Clean interfaces**: Two methods, no configuration
- **Self-managing**: Automatic synthesis and compression

### Cognitive Alignment
- **Impression formation**: Matches human memory patterns
- **Contextual relevance**: Memory meaning determined during reasoning
- **Relational understanding**: User profiles through accumulated interaction

## Validation & Research

- Multi-agent memory architectures

### Phase 3: Situated Cognition Interface (SCI) ðŸ”¬
*Semantic object architecture for relational memory*

```python
# Structured semantic objects replace compressed strings
memory = {
    "identity": {
        "name": "User name",
        "philosophy": "Core beliefs and stance", 
        "orientation": "Worldview and priorities"
    },
    "patterns": {
        "cognitive": "Reasoning style and preferences",
        "behavioral": "Action patterns and habits",
        "design": "Aesthetic and architectural principles"
    },
    "context": {
        "current_project": "Active work focus",
        "milestone": "Recent achievements",
        "concerns": "Present challenges"
    },
    "connections": {
        "project_lineage": "Evolution of work over time",
        "conceptual_evolution": "How ideas have developed", 
        "relationships": "Links between concepts and people"
    }
}
```

**Key principles:**
- **Structured significance** over raw storage
- **Relational priming** over isolated facts  
- **Curated interpretive scaffold** over learned embeddings
- **Semantic objects** with first-class relationships

This enables orientation rather than retrieval - agents understand not just what happened, but what it means and how it connects.
