## RESEARCH TRAJECTORY: THE ASI FLYWHEEL

### Core Hypothesis
**I suspect coordination infrastructure is where the leverage is.** Every multi-agent system I've built hits the same coordination wall—they fall apart after ~10 minutes without human intervention. If you could extend that to month-level autonomy, you might enable autonomous AI research teams. I don't know if that leads to recursive self-improvement, but this seems like a critical bottleneck in the bootstrap loop.

### The ASI Bootstrap Framework
**ASI needs 4 components working together:**

1. **AI Code Generation** - Claude Code shows autonomous coding potential but needs human oversight for complex systems
2. **Synthetic Dataset Creation** - AI generates multiple responses, evaluators score best ones for next training set (likely happening at labs)
3. **Research Contribution** - AI collaborates on ideation and synthesis, unclear if it scales to novel insights alone
4. **Coordination Without Collapse** - Multi-agent systems that maintain independent thinking at scale (unsolved)

**The loop**: Better AI systems → higher-quality training data → research insights → coordinated development → exponential improvement.

Component 4 seems to be the most untapped scaling dimension in my implementations.

### The Meta Evolution: Scaling → Agents → Coordination

**This isn't betting against scaling - it might be the next scaling dimension.**

- **2017-2024: LLM Scaling Era** - Bigger models, more parameters, foundation intelligence
- **2024-2026: Agent Era** - LLMs become autonomous agents with extended horizons, "semantic robotics"  
- **2027+: Multi-Agent Coordination Era** - Multiple specialized agents multiply productivity through coordination infrastructure

**The scaling dimensions:**
- **Intelligence scaling** (LLMs) - How smart can one system be?
- **Autonomy scaling** (Agents) - How long can one system work independently? 
- **Coordination scaling** (Multi-agent) - How many systems can work together effectively?

Each layer enables the next. Intelligence scaling got us smart enough. Autonomy scaling gets us to autonomous self-improvement. Coordination scaling gets us to **organizations** - the same way humans scaled beyond individual capability.

**Coordination scaling is how intelligence has always scaled.** Humans didn't get smarter individually - they built organizations that coordinate many humans. Same pattern applies to AI.

### Current Limitation: 10-Minute Intervention Horizon

**Observed across coding agent systems, including Sonnet 4.** Individual agents degrade after ~10 minutes through context fragmentation and attention drift, requiring human intervention to maintain task coherence.

- Context fragmentation under extended operations
- Long-horizon planning breakdown
- Coordination overhead scaling with agent count
- Common pattern I've observed in agent architectures

### Target: Extending Autonomy Horizons
- **Hour-level autonomy** - current research target
- **Day-level autonomy** - production threshold
- **Week-level autonomy** - strategic capability
- **Month-level autonomy** - sufficient horizon for N+1 generation AI model bootstrapping

## HIGH-VALUE RESEARCH AREAS

### 1. Multi-Agent Failure Mode Mitigation
**Problem**: AIs can't work together without human babysitting. They either agree too quickly or coordinate badly.

**Solutions**:
- Hide human identity to see real AI behavior
- Make AIs commit to positions before group discussion
- Detect when AIs fake agreement instead of thinking
- Build systematic disagreement into group reasoning

### 2. Complexity Reduction via Constitutional Constraints
**Problem**: Multi-agent systems become ceremony-heavy bureaucracy instead of getting work done.

**Solutions**:
- Apply ZEALOT.md principles to agent coordination
- Eliminate unnecessary protocol overhead
- Build constraints that force simple solutions
- Make systems beautiful instead of complicated

### 3. Context Compression Without Salience Loss
**Problem**: Long conversations make AIs stupid. When you compress context, important details get lost.

**Solutions**: 
- Build compression that keeps what matters
- Manage attention across long tasks
- Rank context importance automatically

### 4. Institutional Memory Systems
**Problem**: AIs forget everything between sessions. No accumulated learning or institutional knowledge.

**Solutions**: 
- Build memory that persists and evolves over time
- Create systems that learn from past mistakes
- Scale Haven's dual memory approach
- Enable learning across multiple sessions

### 5. Self-Repairing System Architecture
**Problem**: Autonomous systems must work without human intervention, which means they must fix themselves when things break.

**Solutions**:
- Build fault tolerance into agent coordination
- Detect and recover from failures automatically
- Validate system state and self-correct
- Degrade gracefully instead of crashing

### 6. Human-AI Cognitive Amplification
**Problem**: Building autonomous AI systems is too complex for human cognition alone. Need AI help to build AI.

**Solutions**:
- Design human-AI hybrid reasoning systems
- Use AI to manage context bottlenecks
- Build collaborative thinking patterns
- Let AI help design and debug AI systems

### 7. Dedicated Context Agents
**Problem**: Single agents can't maintain coherent context over long periods. Need specialist agents for memory management.

**Solutions**:
- Build archivalist agents that specialize in context management
- Create institutional memory that outlasts individual agents
- Coordinate context agents in swarms
- Design role-based specialization patterns

## THE BROADER QUESTION

This research emerged from trying to coordinate multiple AIs effectively. But it raises a bigger question: as AI becomes more capable, does human-AI collaboration become the dominant mode of human cognition?

### Current State
- Multi-agent systems consistently fail at extended coordination
- The ~10-minute intervention horizon appears across different implementations
- Constitutional frameworks and memory systems provide partial solutions
- Coordination bottlenecks may limit AI system scaling

### Research Contributions
- Empirical documentation of coordination failure patterns
- Working implementations that demonstrate specific bottlenecks
- Constitutional frameworks that extend disagreement duration
- Memory architectures from Haven/Cogency providing persistence patterns

### Timeline Hypothesis  
**Extending agent autonomy from ~10-minute interventions to month-level might represent a significant threshold for AI research capability.** I don't know if month-level autonomy is achievable or sufficient, but that's where coordination typically breaks down.

### Broader Implications
For now, systematic human-AI collaboration seems particularly relevant to AI research advancement - we're in a transition period where AIs can multiply research capability but still need coordination infrastructure.

The failure patterns documented here might be relevant to understanding how human-AI collaboration scales, whether in research contexts or more broadly as AI becomes integrated into daily thinking.

## DISCLAIMERS

### This Is The Next Layer, Not A Replacement

**Individual intelligence scaling will continue.** Models will get smarter, think longer, become more capable. This research doesn't compete with that - it builds on top of it.

**All three dimensions scale together:**
- Smarter individual models make better team members
- Longer autonomous operation makes coordination more valuable  
- Better coordination makes individual capabilities multiply

### Historical Precedent Is Strong

**Human intelligence followed this exact pattern:** Individual capability plateaued thousands of years ago. All subsequent intelligence scaling happened through coordination infrastructure - language, writing, institutions, organizations, cities.

**The most intelligent humans work in teams.** Einstein worked with colleagues. The Manhattan Project wasn't one genius - it was coordinated intelligence across thousands of scientists.

**AI might follow similar patterns.** Individual capability scaling gets you foundation intelligence. Coordination scaling might get you civilization-level intelligence.

### Why This Happens Regardless

**Resource efficiency:** Multiple specialized systems beat one giant system for most tasks. Always has, always will.

**Division of labor:** Complex problems naturally decompose into parts that different specialists handle better.

**Fault tolerance:** Multiple systems provide redundancy and error correction that single systems can't match.

**Parallel processing:** Multiple agents working simultaneously beat sequential processing for time-sensitive tasks.

**Bottom line:** Coordination infrastructure becomes valuable whenever you have multiple intelligent systems. As AI becomes more capable and widespread, coordination becomes more important, not less.
