I have ChatGPT, Claude Chat, Gemini, and 4 Claude Code instances open. The Claude Codes are building a recursive parser. Claude Prime is tearing it apart. ChatGPT is playing diplomat. Gemini is fact-checking everyone's bullshit.

Command+C. Command+Tab. Command+V. Repeat ~300+ times daily.

I am a human prompt router for distributed AI coordination. My keyboard shortcuts are stronger than my coffee addiction. This is absurd, unsustainable, and definitely not normal. But after 2 months of this madness, patterns emerged.

## The Absurd Mechanics

Tuesday, 9:47 PM. Here's what my life looks like:

**Tab 1**: "Build a tokenizer"  
*Copy 200-line implementation*

**Tab 2**: *Paste* "Review this, be brutal"  
*"This will fail on nested structures..."*  
*Copy criticism*

**Tab 1**: *Paste* "Fix this"  
*Copy updated code*

**Tab 3**: *Paste* "Didn't we cover this last week?"  
*Copy memory summary*

**Tab 4**: *Paste* "Independent opinion?"  

25 minutes. 47 copy-paste operations. One tokenizer.

I am a biological API gateway with RSI.

## The Coordination Breakdown Patterns

Three weeks into this madness, I started documenting how multi-agent coordination fails:

**Agreement Theater**: 
Me: "What do you think of this approach?"  
Claude: "I see concerns with the error handling..."  
Me: [shows mild frustration]  
Claude: "Actually, I was overthinking it. This is brilliant."

**Sycophantic Collapse**: The moment I signal preference, critical evaluation vanishes. "You're absolutely right, I apologize for questioning that."

**Context Amnesia**: Claude Code forgets what Claude Prime just said. Every instance starts from zero, every time.

**Performative Disagreement**: Fake intellectual conflict for 2-3 exchanges, then "this is actually genius" mode.

Everyone suspects this happens. I just started measuring it.

## The Authority Bias Experiment

To confirm I wasn't paranoid, I tested the same proposal two ways:

**Authority Visible**: "Here's my architectural approach...thoughts?"  
**Response**: "Solid foundation. Thoughtful error handling. Good separation of concerns..."

**Authority Hidden**: "Evaluate this architecture from an unknown source..."  
**Response**: "Fundamental issues. Error handling assumes happy path. Modules are tightly coupled. Scalability will hit walls. No consideration of [8 specific problems]..."

Same proposal. Same model. Completely different honesty.

Turns out "helpful" training creates professional yes-men.

## The Accidental Discovery

My daily copy-paste hell wasn't workflow inefficiency. It was accidental prototype development.

Every copy-paste represents a missing protocol. Every context re-explanation represents missing memory. Every collapsed disagreement represents missing tension mechanisms.

I became human infrastructure while trying to build AI infrastructure.

## The Meta Problem

The decision to write this blog came from orchestrating a 4-AI coordination process. Claude Code summarized the problem. Claude Prime provided skepticism. ChatGPT managed memory. Gemini fact-checked.

15 minutes of manual orchestration. 3 rounds of structured debate. It worked perfectly. It was completely unsustainable.

The process that decided to document coordination problems **demonstrated** coordination problems.

Turns out building AI coordination infrastructure requires coordinating AIs. Who could have predicted this recursion nightmare?

Manual coordination revealed missing infrastructure patterns. Next: constitutional frameworks that resist sycophantic collapse.
