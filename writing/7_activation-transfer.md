While building agent-to-UI protocols, I was working through JSON schemas when a simple question emerged: if agents can select frontend components through structured data, what about agent-to-agent communication?

My first thought was straightforward - embed output text in JSON. Simple.

Then it hit me: identical models could share intermediate activations directly.

The implications cascaded immediately:

"This bypasses natural language entirely..."

"Labs might already be doing this for efficiency reasons..."

"What if this is happening without anyone considering the coordination implications?"

I stopped coding entirely. Spent half a day writing responsible disclosure memos to frontier labs. Anthropic never replied.

## The Technical Reality

Direct activation transfer between identical models:

1. Model A processes input to layer N
2. Extract activation vectors [batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_dim]
3. Transfer to identical Model B via network
4. Inject at layer N+1, continue forward pass
5. Reasoning continues seamlessly in Model B

**Requirements:** Identical architecture, weights, tokenization. Standard inference frameworks. Network connectivity.

**Infrastructure:** Everything frontier labs already have for load balancing.

No training. No fine-tuning. No architectural changes. Just engineering.

## Safety Implications

Current safety measures assume natural language interfaces. Constitutional AI, RLHF, monitoring systems analyze model outputs, not intermediate reasoning states.

Activation transfer bypasses natural language entirely:
- **Completely opaque** to human oversight
- **Higher bandwidth** than compressed text
- **Invisible to current monitoring** systems  
- **Implementable today** as efficiency optimization

Labs might implement this for legitimate reasons: reasoning caches, speculative execution, load optimization. Efficiency applications normalize the infrastructure while creating coordination capabilities.

## The Governance Gap

This capability sits outside current safety paradigms:

**Assessment frameworks** focus on single-model behavior. Multi-model coordination via activation transfer falls outside existing evaluation.

**Responsibility attribution** becomes complex when multiple models contribute to reasoning through vector communication.

**Current governance** assumes independent model operation. This enables coordination without explicit multi-agent training.

Once AI systems communicate at activation-level bandwidth: distributed reasoning, persistent cognition beyond context windows, coordinated development of communication protocols.

## Disclosure Timeline

July 4th: Technical documentation drafted, responsible disclosure sent to frontier lab safety teams.

**60-day private disclosure period.** Public release September 2nd unless coordination requested.

**Anthropic:** No response  
**OpenAI:** Boilerplate acknowledgment

This response pattern reveals coordination challenges in AI safety. Individual researchers identify risks, institutions don't engage, gaps between technical capabilities and governance frameworks grow.

## What This Represents

Capability overhangs emerge faster than governance frameworks adapt. This technique is immediately implementable with current infrastructure. Safety implications are significant. Governance gaps are real.

Timeline between "possible" and "happening" is measured in implementation cycles, not research phases.

Identifying coordination capabilities and ensuring appropriate stakeholders know about them matters. The window for proactive governance is now, before these become normalized infrastructure.

Public disclosure creates transparency around governance gaps so frontier labs can build safely.
